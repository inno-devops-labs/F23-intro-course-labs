Tool Name: Jenkins
Description: Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices. It provides a platform for building, testing, and deploying software applications efficiently.
Purpose and Benefits: The purpose of Jenkins is to automate the entire software development lifecycle, from code integration to deployment. It enables developers to integrate their code changes frequently, detect issues early, and automate the deployment process.
Key Features and Functionalities:
    1. Continuous Integration (CI): Jenkins enables continuous integration by automatically building and testing code changes whenever they are committed to a version control system (e.g., Git).
    2. Distributed Build and Scalability: Jenkins supports distributed builds across multiple nodes, allowing parallel execution of tasks and efficient resource utilization.
    3. Extensibility and Plugin Ecosystem: Jenkins has a vast plugin ecosystem, offering integrations with various tools and technologies used in the software development process.
    4. Build Pipelines: Jenkins enables the creation of complex build pipelines that define the stages and actions required for software delivery.
    5. Automated Testing: Jenkins integrates with various testing frameworks, allowing the execution of automated tests as part of the CI/CD process.
    6. Monitoring and Notifications: Jenkins provides monitoring and alerting capabilities, enabling users to monitor build statuses, track performance metrics, and receive notifications via email, chat tools, or other channels.
    7. Version Control Integration: Jenkins integrates with popular version control systems, such as Git, enabling automatic triggering of builds upon code changes.
    8. Security and Access Control: Jenkins offers features for securing build environments, managing user access, and enforcing fine-grained permissions.
