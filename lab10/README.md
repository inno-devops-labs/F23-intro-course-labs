# Cloud Computing Lab - Artifact Registries and Serverless Computing Platforms

In this lab assignment, you will research and compare artifact registries and serverless computing platforms in AWS, GCP, and Azure. You will document your findings in a single Markdown file, providing information on popular artifact registries and the best serverless computing platforms in each cloud platform. Follow the tasks below to complete the lab assignment.

## Task 1: Artifact Registries Research

**To achieve a grade of 6/10**, follow these steps:

1. Research Artifact Registries:
   - Explore AWS, GCP, and Azure services and documentation to identify the most popular artifact registries available.
   - Document the names of the artifact registries and their key features in a Markdown file named "Cloud_Services.md" in the lab folder.
   - Use appropriate headings and bullet points to present your findings.

## Task 2: Serverless Computing Platform Research

To earn an additional 4 points, follow these steps for researching serverless computing platforms:

1. Research Best Serverless Computing Platforms:
   - Investigate AWS, GCP, and Azure services and resources to identify the best serverless computing platforms available on each cloud platform.
   - Document the names of the serverless computing platforms and their key features in the same "Cloud_Services.md" file.
   - Use appropriate headings and bullet points to present your findings.

### Guidelines

- Use proper Markdown formatting and structure for the documentation file.
- Organize the file within the lab folder using an appropriate name like "Cloud_Services.md".
- Create a Pull Request to the main branch of the repository with your completed lab assignment.

> Note: Actively explore the cloud platforms' documentation and resources to gather information about the artifact registries and serverless computing platforms. Document your findings and observations in the Markdown file, providing a clear comparison of the offerings across the three cloud platforms.
